The Clog V4
===========

The Clog V4 is a 34-key split keyboard. It has the following features:

- Choc V1 switches
- Wired or wireless with Seeeduino Xiao controllers
- Pinky clusters (top pinky keys on the sides)
- Splay (4Â° between middle and ring and between ring and pinky)
- Hotswap with a switch plate for stability
- SplitKB puck support for tenting

## How to Order

The gerber ZIPs ((PCB)[./gerber/clog-v4.zip] and (plate)[./gerber/clog-v4-plate.zip])
have everything you'll need to get this printed. You can order from [JLC](https://jlcpcb.com)
by just uploading the ZIP archives and keeping the default options. I'd suggest removing
the order number, otherwise they'll put one on the boards somewhere randomly.

### Tips

I'd solder the parts in this order:

- Diodes
- Hotswap sockets
- Power switches
- MCU sockets/Headers that came with the Xiao's
- MCU pins if you're [socketing](https://docs.splitkb.com/hc/en-us/articles/360011263059-How-do-I-socket-a-microcontroller-)
- Batteries (To the +ve pad under the controller and to the -ve hole on the board)
- The "bodge" wire from the "Reset" hole to the reset pad under the controller
